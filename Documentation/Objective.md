# Build/code the fastest/best City Temperature API

Provide a small web application that produces a simple API with 2 endpoints that returns JSON with the following characteristics.

## Inputs

1. City Name with other geographic information and User Local Time
2. Country Name (to determine Capital City Name) and User Local Time

## Outputs

1. City Name’s or Capital City Name’s (if Country Name endpoint is called) with that city’s Local Current Temperature.
2. The difference in User Local Time and City local Time.

## Metrics

1. Functional test, i.e. does it work how it is supposed to.
2. Code quality, i.e. can we understand it and maintain it.
3. Time server-side required to process and return the API call - measured in milli-seconds (or higher resolution where available).
4. If time allows provide additional embellishments to the solution as you see fit.

## Rules

1. Any backend language/framework you are comfortable with e.g. Java, Node, Python, C#, etc.
2. Code can run locally or be hosted online (if hosted provide URL).
3. Use any free public or opensource APIs that you require to meet the requirements such as <https://openweathermap.org/api>
4. Document your code and challenges.
5. You may copy code from or refer to another library or open source - but please reference them.

## Submission

1. Create a public GitHub or similar public repo and share it when finished.
2. Prepare to present your application, your approach, your project setup and your code, etc.
